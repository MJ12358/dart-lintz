# Dart Lintz

- A **very** strict set of [Dart](https://dart.dev) lint rules.

- Inspired by strictly typed languages like [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/) and [Apex](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_dev_guide.htm)

## How to enable these lints

- Add this to your `pubspec.yaml`

```yaml
dart_lintz: ^1.0.0-dev
```

- Add this to your `analysis_options.yaml`

```yaml
include: package:dart_lintz/dart_lintz.yaml
```
